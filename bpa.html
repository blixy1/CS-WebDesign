	<div class="card"> <h3>Bella's story</h3> <body> Bella wakes up every morning feeling like she’s carrying a weight no one else can see, moving through her day as if the world is wrapped in fog, and even the things she used to love—like music and sketching—feel far away, like they belong to someone she used to be; she tells people she’s “fine” because it’s easier than trying to explain the hollow ache in her chest, but inside she feels tired, lonely, and frustrated with herself for not being able to just “snap out of it,” and yet, one quiet evening, after staring at her phone for way too long, she finally messages her best friend and admits she’s not okay, and in that small moment she feels a flicker of relief, like maybe letting someone in could be the first tiny step toward feeling something like herself again.

            <body>
              Ben wakes up before his alarm with that familiar tightness in his chest, the kind that makes it feel like someone wrapped a rope around his lungs overnight, and as he sits on the edge of his bed trying to breathe through the rising panic, he reminds himself that nothing is actually wrong—even though his mind insists on creating danger out of thin air—so he shuffles to the kitchen, cradling a warm mug of coffee he’s too afraid to drink in case the caffeine fuels the fire already burning in his chest, and when his phone buzzes with a message from Maya asking if he’s good for lunch, his anxiety instantly floods him with imagined awkward silences and clumsy words, but then he remembers her smile and the sunlight on their usual café table, and with a shaky breath he forces himself to erase the cancellation he started typing and instead writes “Yeah. Lunch sounds good,” hitting send before he can back out, feeling the anxiety ease just the smallest bit—never gone, but far enough away that he can breathe again, at least for now.

		John struggled with bipolar disorder, which made his moods change a lot some days he felt full of energy and ideas, and other days he felt tired and sad for no reason. At first, he didn’t know why it happened, but after talking with his mom and seeing a doctor, he learned what it was and started getting help. With medicine, therapy, and support from people who cared about him, John began to understand himself better and find balance. Even though some days were still hard, he learned that having bipolar didn’t mean he was broken it just meant he had to take care of his mind like anyone else.

          <h3>Isaiah's story</h3>
	<body>
    Sometimes I wake up already hearing the whispers, like someone left a radio on in another room, and I have to remind myself—out loud—that the voices aren’t real, even though they feel like they are talking straight to me. I move slowly through my morning, grounding myself by touching the cool kitchen counter or counting the blue tiles on the floor, anything to pull my mind back into my body. Some days the shadows in the corner stay still, letting me breathe, and other days they twitch and flicker like they’re waiting for me to look away. But I’m learning to talk back to my fear, to tell myself that what I see and hear doesn’t control me, and when I step outside and feel the sun on my face, even for a second, it feels like proof that I can still live my life—one breath, one moment—without letting the illness decide who I am.
